Specifically, the analysis will examine whether metrics such as goals and assists along with player age, are associated with higher market valuations, considering that younger players are often valued more highly than older players. By combining performance, age, and financial data, this project aims to uncover patterns linking athletic output and age to financial worth."

Players aged 23–26 exhibit the highest median market value and the widest range of valuations, indicating peak financial worth during early career stages. Market values decline progressively in older age groups, with players aged 31–35 showing substantially lower valuations. This visualization demonstrates a negative relationship between age and market value after the mid-twenties."
